# Building Smart Contracts with ink! 🦑
## Our Journey as 42 Berlin Students joining the Web3 Summit Hackathon

*How we went from "What's ink!?" to crafting a fully functional Agario game smart contract treasury built on ink! in less than 48 hours*

---

## Introduction:

So we've been coding for nearly 20 hours straight, building something we'd never attempted before – a smart contract for our Agario-style game, and this is our process:

"Wait, why is this function not payable?" whispers Sarah, pointing at her screen.

"Because you forgot the `#[ink(message, payable)]` attribute again!" laughs Marcus, not looking up from his debugging session.

This is our story. We're computer science students who barely knew some Rust, had heard about blockchain, but had never actually built a smart contract. Fast forward 48 hours, and we had a fully functional game treasury managing player buy-ins, prize distribution, and complex game state management.

If we can do it, so can you. This tutorial will take you on the same journey we took – from the basics to building sophisticated smart contracts with ink!, Polkadot's smart contract language.

### Why ink!?

During our hackathon research phase, we discovered ink! and immediately fell in love with it:

- **It's Rust**: We already knew Rust from 42 Berlin's curriculum
- **Polkadot ecosystem**: Better interoperability and lower fees than Ethereum
- **Safety first**: Rust's ownership model prevents many common smart contract vulnerabilities
- **Great tooling**: Excellent development experience with clear error messages

Let's dive into the world of ink! smart contracts together!

## Chapter 1: Your First Smart Contract - The Flipper

### The "Hello World" of Smart Contracts

Every programming journey starts with "Hello World", and in the smart contract world, that's the Flipper. It's simple: a boolean value that you can flip between `true` and `false`. Think of it as a light switch on the blockchain.

Here's our first smart contract:

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std, no_main)]

#[ink::contract]
mod flipper {

    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct Flipper {
        value: bool,
    }

    impl Flipper {
        /// Constructor that initializes our flipper to false
        #[ink(constructor)]
        pub fn new() -> Self {
            Self { value: false }
        }

        /// Flips the current value
        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn flip(&mut self) {
            self.value = !self.value;
        }

        /// Returns the current value
        #[ink(message)]
        pub fn get(&self) -> bool {
            self.value
        }
    }
}
```

### Breaking It Down

Let's understand what each part does:

**1. The Module Declaration**
```rust
#[ink::contract]
mod flipper {
```
This tells ink! "Hey, this module contains a smart contract!" The `#[ink::contract]` attribute is like a magic spell that transforms regular Rust code into blockchain-compatible smart contract code.

**2. Storage Definition**
```rust
#[ink(storage)]
pub struct Flipper {
    value: bool,
}
```
This is where we define what data our contract stores on the blockchain. Think of it as your contract's memory – anything in this struct will persist between function calls.

**3. Constructor**
```rust
#[ink(constructor)]
pub fn new() -> Self {
    Self { value: false }
}
```
Constructors run only once when the contract is deployed. It's like the setup function that initializes your contract's state.

**4. Messages (Functions)**
```rust
#[ink(message)]
pub fn flip(&mut self) {
    self.value = !self.value;
}
```
Messages are functions that can be called from outside the contract. Notice `&mut self` – this means the function can modify the contract's state.

### Our First "Aha!" Moment

During the hackathon, Emma got confused about `&self` vs `&mut self`:

- `&self`: Read-only access (like `get()`)
- `&mut self`: Can modify storage (like `flip()`)

This is crucial because blockchain transactions that modify state cost gas, while read-only calls are often free!

### Try It Yourself!

Create a new contract that:
1. Stores a counter (u32)
2. Has functions to increment, decrement, and get the current value
3. Includes a constructor that sets an initial value

**Solution:**
```rust
#[ink(storage)]
pub struct Counter {
    value: u32,
}

impl Counter {
    #[ink(constructor)]
    pub fn new(init_value: u32) -> Self {
        Self { value: init_value }
    }

    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn increment(&mut self) {
        self.value += 1;
    }

    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn decrement(&mut self) {
        self.value = self.value.saturating_sub(1);
    }

    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn get(&self) -> u32 {
        self.value
    }
}
```

---

## Chapter 2: Storing Data Like a Pro

### Beyond Simple Types

Our Flipper was cute, but real applications need more sophisticated data storage. Let's see what types we can store in ink! contracts:

```rust
#[ink(storage)]
pub struct MyContract {
    // Basic types
    my_bool: bool,
    my_number: u32,
    my_balance: Balance,

    // Blockchain-specific types
    my_account: AccountId,
    my_hash: Hash,

    // Dynamic types (using ink::prelude)
    my_string: String,
    my_vector: Vec<u32>,
}
```

### The Magic of AccountId

`AccountId` is super important – it represents a user's address on the blockchain. In our Agario game, we use it to track which player is which:

```rust
use ink::prelude::vec::Vec;

#[ink(storage)]
pub struct SimpleGame {
    players: Vec<AccountId>,
    admin: AccountId,
}

impl SimpleGame {
    #[ink(constructor)]
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            players: Vec::new(),
            admin: Self::env().caller(), // Whoever deploys becomes admin
        }
    }

    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn join_game(&mut self) {
        let player = Self::env().caller();
        if !self.players.contains(&player) {
            self.players.push(player);
        }
    }

    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn get_player_count(&self) -> u32 {
        self.players.len() as u32
    }
}
```

### A Lesson from Our Debugging Session

At 2 AM, Marcus discovered something important about storage: **Everything in the storage struct persists on the blockchain forever**. This means:

- Storage is expensive (costs gas)
- You should only store what you absolutely need
- Large vectors can become expensive to iterate over

---

## Chapter 3: Managing Multiple Players with Mapping

### The Game-Changer: ink::storage::Mapping

When building our Agario game, we quickly realized that storing player data in a `Vec` wasn't efficient. What if we had 1000 players? Searching through a vector every time would be expensive!

Enter `Mapping` – ink!'s equivalent of a hash map, but optimized for blockchain storage:

```rust
use ink::storage::Mapping;

#[ink(storage)]
pub struct PlayerRegistry {
    // Maps player AccountId to their balance
    balances: Mapping<AccountId, Balance>,
    player_count: u32,
}

impl PlayerRegistry {
    #[ink(constructor)]
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            balances: Mapping::default(),
            player_count: 0,
        }
    }

    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn register_player(&mut self, initial_balance: Balance) {
        let player = self.env().caller();

        // Check if player is already registered
        if self.balances.get(player).is_none() {
            self.balances.insert(player, &initial_balance);
            self.player_count += 1;
        }
    }

    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn get_balance(&self) -> Option<Balance> {
        let player = self.env().caller();
        self.balances.get(player)
    }

    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn is_registered(&self, player: AccountId) -> bool {
        self.balances.get(player).is_some()
    }
}
```

### Key Mapping Operations

```rust
// Insert or update
self.balances.insert(key, &value);

// Get value (returns Option<T>)
let balance = self.balances.get(key);

// Remove value
self.balances.remove(key);

// Check if key exists
let exists = self.balances.contains(key);
```

### Our Mapping Discovery

During development, we learned that `Mapping::get()` returns an `Option<T>`. This confused us initially:

```rust
// Wrong! This panics if player doesn't exist
let balance = self.balances.get(player).unwrap();

// Right! Handle the case where player doesn't exist
let balance = self.balances.get(player).unwrap_or(0);

// Even better! Use pattern matching
match self.balances.get(player) {
    Some(balance) => balance,
    None => return Err(Error::PlayerNotFound),
}
```

## Chapter 4: Game States and Smart Logic

### Managing Complexity with Enums

Real games have different phases: waiting for players, active gameplay, distributing prizes. We needed a way to track which phase our game was in. Enter Rust enums!

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, Copy, scale::Encode, scale::Decode)]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "std", derive(scale_info::TypeInfo))]
pub enum GameState {
    WaitingForPlayers,
    Active,
    Finished,
}

#[ink(storage)]
pub struct Game {
    state: GameState,
    players: Mapping<AccountId, ()>,
    player_count: u32,
    winner: Option<AccountId>,
}
```

### State Transitions

State machines are powerful for managing game logic:

```rust
impl Game {
    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn start_game(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error> {
        // Only allow starting from waiting state
        if self.state != GameState::WaitingForPlayers {
            return Err(Error::InvalidGameState);
        }

        // Need at least 2 players
        if self.player_count < 2 {
            return Err(Error::NotEnoughPlayers);
        }

        self.state = GameState::Active;
        Ok(())
    }

    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn end_game(&mut self, winner: AccountId) -> Result<(), Error> {
        if self.state != GameState::Active {
            return Err(Error::GameNotActive);
        }

        self.winner = Some(winner);
        self.state = GameState::Finished;
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### The Power of Pattern Matching

We discovered that Rust's pattern matching made game logic much clearer:

```rust
#[ink(message)]
pub fn join_game(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error> {
    match self.state {
        GameState::WaitingForPlayers => {
            let player = self.env().caller();
            if !self.players.contains(player) {
                self.players.insert(player, &());
                self.player_count += 1;
                Ok(())
            } else {
                Err(Error::AlreadyJoined)
            }
        },
        GameState::Active => Err(Error::GameAlreadyStarted),
        GameState::Finished => Err(Error::GameFinished),
    }
}
```

## Chapter 5: Handling Money - The Payable World

### Making Functions Accept Payment

The exciting part of our Agario game was handling real money! Players pay to join, and winners get the prize pool. This required learning about payable functions:

```rust
#[ink(storage)]
pub struct GameTreasury {
    buy_in_amount: Balance,
    prize_pool: Balance,
    players: Mapping<AccountId, ()>,
}

impl GameTreasury {
    #[ink(constructor)]
    pub fn new(buy_in: Balance) -> Self {
        Self {
            buy_in_amount: buy_in,
            prize_pool: 0,
            players: Mapping::default(),
        }
    }

    /// Players call this to join the game and pay the buy-in
    #[ink(message, payable)]
    pub fn join_game(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error> {
        let player = self.env().caller();
        let payment = self.env().transferred_value();

        // Check correct payment amount
        if payment != self.buy_in_amount {
            return Err(Error::IncorrectPayment);
        }

        // Check if already joined
        if self.players.contains(player) {
            return Err(Error::AlreadyJoined);
        }

        // Add player and update prize pool
        self.players.insert(player, &());
        self.prize_pool += payment;

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Transferring Money Out

Paying winners requires transferring money from the contract:

```rust
#[ink(message)]
pub fn distribute_prize(&mut self, winner: AccountId) -> Result<(), Error> {
    // Only admin can distribute
    if self.env().caller() != self.admin {
        return Err(Error::NotAuthorized);
    }

    // Transfer the prize pool to the winner
    self.env().transfer(winner, self.prize_pool)
        .map_err(|_| Error::TransferFailed)?;

    // Reset the game
    self.prize_pool = 0;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Our Money-Handling Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Forgetting `payable`**
```rust
// Wrong! This can't receive payments
#[ink(message)]
pub fn join_game(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error> {

// Right! Now it can receive payments
#[ink(message, payable)]
pub fn join_game(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error> {
```

**Mistake 2: Not checking payment amounts**
```rust
// Wrong! Accepts any payment
let payment = self.env().transferred_value();
self.prize_pool += payment;

// Right! Validates the exact amount
if payment != self.buy_in_amount {
    return Err(Error::IncorrectPayment);
}
```

**Mistake 3: Forgetting about gas for transfers**
```rust
// The transfer might fail! Always handle the Result
self.env().transfer(winner, amount)
    .map_err(|_| Error::TransferFailed)?;
```

## Chapter 6: Access Control - Who's the Boss?

### Admin Patterns

Our game needed an admin who could start games, end them, and manage the treasury. Here's how we implemented secure admin controls:

```rust
#[ink(storage)]
pub struct AdminControlledGame {
    admin: AccountId,
    // ... other storage
}

impl AdminControlledGame {
    #[ink(constructor)]
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            admin: Self::env().caller(), // Deployer becomes admin
            // ... initialize other fields
        }
    }

    /// Modifier function to check admin access
    fn ensure_admin(&self) -> Result<(), Error> {
        if self.env().caller() != self.admin {
            return Err(Error::NotAuthorized);
        }
        Ok(())
    }

    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn start_game(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error> {
        self.ensure_admin()?;
        // ... game starting logic
        Ok(())
    }

    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn emergency_stop(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error> {
        self.ensure_admin()?;
        // ... emergency logic
        Ok(())
    }

    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn transfer_admin(&mut self, new_admin: AccountId) -> Result<(), Error> {
        self.ensure_admin()?;
        self.admin = new_admin;
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Multi-Level Access Control

For more complex scenarios, you might need different permission levels:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Clone, Copy, scale::Encode, scale::Decode)]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "std", derive(scale_info::TypeInfo))]
pub enum Role {
    Admin,
    Moderator,
    Player,
}

#[ink(storage)]
pub struct RoleBasedGame {
    roles: Mapping<AccountId, Role>,
    admin: AccountId,
}

impl RoleBasedGame {
    fn get_role(&self, account: AccountId) -> Role {
        self.roles.get(account).unwrap_or(Role::Player)
    }

    fn ensure_role(&self, required_role: Role) -> Result<(), Error> {
        let caller_role = self.get_role(self.env().caller());
        match (required_role, caller_role) {
            (Role::Player, _) => Ok(()),
            (Role::Moderator, Role::Moderator | Role::Admin) => Ok(()),
            (Role::Admin, Role::Admin) => Ok(()),
            _ => Err(Error::InsufficientPermissions),
        }
    }
}
```

### Security Lesson Learned

At 4 AM, we almost shipped a contract where anyone could call the `distribute_prize` function! Always remember:

1. **Check permissions first**: Never trust the caller
2. **Use the principle of least privilege**: Only give the minimum required access
3. **Test access control**: Write tests for unauthorized access attempts

---

## Chapter 7: Error Handling - When Things Go Wrong

### Custom Error Types

Nothing taught us about error handling faster than a hackathon deadline! We learned to create comprehensive error enums:

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, scale::Encode, scale::Decode)]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "std", derive(scale_info::TypeInfo))]
pub enum Error {
    // Access control errors
    NotAuthorized,
    NotAdmin,

    // Game state errors
    GameNotStarted,
    GameAlreadyStarted,
    GameFinished,
    InvalidGameState,

    // Player errors
    PlayerNotFound,
    AlreadyJoined,
    NotEnoughPlayers,
    TooManyPlayers,

    // Payment errors
    IncorrectPayment,
    InsufficientFunds,
    TransferFailed,

    // Timing errors
    RegistrationClosed,
    TooEarly,
    TooLate,
}
```

### The Result Pattern

Every function that can fail should return a `Result`:

```rust
pub type Result<T> = core::result::Result<T, Error>;

#[ink(message)]
pub fn join_game(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
    // Validate game state
    if self.game_state != GameState::AcceptingPlayers {
        return Err(Error::RegistrationClosed);
    }

    // Validate player hasn't joined
    let player = self.env().caller();
    if self.players.contains(player) {
        return Err(Error::AlreadyJoined);
    }

    // Validate payment
    let payment = self.env().transferred_value();
    if payment != self.buy_in_amount {
        return Err(Error::IncorrectPayment);
    }

    // All good! Add the player
    self.players.insert(player, &());
    self.player_count += 1;

    Ok(())
}
```

### Error Handling Best Practices

**1. Fail Fast and Clear**
```rust
// Good: Check conditions early and return specific errors
if self.game_state != GameState::Active {
    return Err(Error::GameNotActive);
}

if self.env().caller() != self.admin {
    return Err(Error::NotAuthorized);
}
```

**2. Use the `?` Operator**
```rust
// Instead of this:
match self.validate_player() {
    Ok(()) => {},
    Err(e) => return Err(e),
}

// Use this:
self.validate_player()?;
```

**3. Provide Context**
```rust
// Better error messages help debugging
pub enum Error {
    InvalidBuyIn(Balance, Balance), // (expected, actual)
    PlayerLimit(u32),             // max_players
    InsufficientBalance(Balance, Balance), // (required, available)
}
```

## Chapter 8: Testing Your Contract

### Why Testing Saved Our Hackathon

At 6 AM on the final day, Sarah's test caught a critical bug in our prize distribution logic. Without tests, we would have shipped a contract that could lose players' money!

### Unit Testing Basics

ink! makes testing straightforward with the `#[ink::test]` attribute:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[ink::test]
    fn constructor_works() {
        let contract = Game::new(1000);
        assert_eq!(contract.get_buy_in(), 1000);
        assert_eq!(contract.get_player_count(), 0);
    }

    #[ink::test]
    fn join_game_works() {
        let mut contract = Game::new(1000);
        // In tests, we can't easily simulate payments,
        // so we test the logic separately
        let result = contract.add_player_internal(AccountId::from([1; 32]));
        assert!(result.is_ok());
        assert_eq!(contract.get_player_count(), 1);
    }

    #[ink::test]
    fn prevents_double_join() {
        let mut contract = Game::new(1000);
        let player = AccountId::from([1; 32]);

        contract.add_player_internal(player).unwrap();
        let result = contract.add_player_internal(player);

        assert_eq!(result, Err(Error::AlreadyJoined));
    }
}
```

### Testing State Transitions

```rust
#[ink::test]
fn game_state_transitions() {
    let mut contract = Game::new(1000);

    // Initial state
    assert_eq!(contract.get_game_state(), GameState::WaitingForPlayers);

    // Can't start without players
    let result = contract.start_game();
    assert_eq!(result, Err(Error::NotEnoughPlayers));

    // Add players
    contract.add_player_internal(AccountId::from([1; 32])).unwrap();
    contract.add_player_internal(AccountId::from([2; 32])).unwrap();

    // Now we can start
    contract.start_game().unwrap();
    assert_eq!(contract.get_game_state(), GameState::Active);

    // Can't join active game
    let result = contract.add_player_internal(AccountId::from([3; 32]));
    assert_eq!(result, Err(Error::GameAlreadyStarted));
}
```

### Testing Access Control

```rust
#[ink::test]
fn only_admin_can_start_game() {
    let mut contract = Game::new(1000);

    // Mock different caller (in real tests, you'd use test environment)
    // This is simplified for illustration
    let result = contract.start_game();

    // Should work for admin
    assert!(result.is_ok());
}
```

### Testing Patterns We Learned

**1. Test the Happy Path First**
```rust
#[ink::test]
fn complete_game_flow() {
    let mut game = Game::new(1000);

    // Add players
    game.add_player_internal(AccountId::from([1; 32])).unwrap();
    game.add_player_internal(AccountId::from([2; 32])).unwrap();

    // Start game
    game.start_game().unwrap();

    // End game
    game.end_game(AccountId::from([1; 32])).unwrap();

    assert_eq!(game.get_game_state(), GameState::Finished);
}
```

**2. Test Edge Cases**
```rust
#[ink::test]
fn edge_cases() {
    let mut game = Game::new(0); // Zero buy-in
    let result = game.join_game();
    // What should happen here?

    let mut game = Game::new(u128::MAX); // Maximum buy-in
    // Test overflow protection
}
```

**3. Test Error Conditions**
```rust
#[ink::test]
fn error_conditions() {
    let mut game = Game::new(1000);

    // Test each error condition
    assert_eq!(game.start_game(), Err(Error::NotEnoughPlayers));
    assert_eq!(game.end_game(AccountId::from([1; 32])), Err(Error::GameNotActive));
}
```

## Chapter 9: Putting It All Together - Our Agario Game Contract

### The Final Product

After 48 hours of coding, debugging, and lots of coffee, here's what our Agario game contract looked like (simplified version):

```rust
#![cfg_attr(not(feature = "std"), no_std, no_main)]

#[ink::contract]
mod agario_game {
    use ink::storage::Mapping;

```

### What Made This Contract Special

**1. Clear State Management**
We used enums to make game states explicit and prevent invalid transitions.

**2. Comprehensive Error Handling**
Every function that could fail returned a `Result` with specific error types.

**3. Security First**
Access controls ensured only the admin could manage the game, and players could only join once.

**4. Gas Efficiency**
We used `Mapping` for O(1) player lookups and separated read-only queries from state-changing operations.

**5. Real Money Handling**
Payable functions and secure transfers handled the prize pool safely.

### Lessons from the Hackathon

**What Went Right:**
- Starting with simple examples and building up
- Writing tests early caught critical bugs
- Rust's type system prevented many common smart contract vulnerabilities
- ink!'s tooling made development smooth

**What We'd Do Differently:**
- Plan the storage layout more carefully upfront
- Write more comprehensive integration tests
- Consider gas optimization earlier
- Document our functions better

### Performance and Gas Optimization

During testing, we learned some important optimization techniques:

**1. Minimize Storage Reads/Writes**
```rust
// Inefficient: Multiple storage reads
fn bad_example(&mut self) {
    if self.player_count > 0 {
        self.player_count -= 1;
        if self.player_count == 0 {
            // Do something
        }
    }
}

// Efficient: Read once, modify local variable
fn good_example(&mut self) {
    let mut count = self.player_count;
    if count > 0 {
        count -= 1;
        if count == 0 {
            // Do something
        }
        self.player_count = count; // Write once at the end
    }
}
```

**2. Use Appropriate Data Structures**
- `Mapping` for key-value lookups
- `Vec` for ordered lists you need to iterate
- Simple fields for single values

**3. Batch Operations**
```rust
// Instead of multiple individual operations
fn distribute_prizes(&mut self, winners: Vec<(AccountId, Balance)>) -> Result<()> {
    for (winner, amount) in winners {
        self.env().transfer(winner, amount)
            .map_err(|_| Error::TransferFailed)?;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

## Chapter 10: Beyond the Hackathon - Advanced Patterns

### Events for Frontend Integration

Although we commented out events in our hackathon contract due to compilation issues, they're crucial for real applications:

```rust
/// Events help frontends track contract state changes
#[ink(event)]
pub struct PlayerJoined {
    #[ink(topic)]
    pub player: AccountId,
    pub player_count: u32,
    pub prize_pool: Balance,
}

#[ink(event)]
pub struct GameStarted {
    pub player_count: u32,
    pub prize_pool: Balance,
}

#[ink(event)]
pub struct WinnerDeclared {
    #[ink(topic)]
    pub winner: AccountId,
    pub prize_amount: Balance,
}

// Emit events in your functions
#[ink(message, payable)]
pub fn join_game(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
    // ... validation logic ...

    self.players.insert(player, &());
    self.player_count += 1;
    self.prize_pool += payment;

    // Emit event for frontend
    self.env().emit_event(PlayerJoined {
        player,
        player_count: self.player_count,
        prize_pool: self.prize_pool,
    });

    Ok(())
}
```

### Upgradeable Contracts

For production systems, you might need upgradeable contracts:

```rust
#[ink(storage)]
pub struct UpgradeableGame {
    admin: AccountId,
    implementation: Hash, // Hash of the implementation contract
    // ... other storage
}

impl UpgradeableGame {
    #[ink(message)]
    pub fn upgrade(&mut self, new_implementation: Hash) -> Result<()> {
        if self.env().caller() != self.admin {
            return Err(Error::NotAuthorized);
        }

        self.implementation = new_implementation;
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Cross-Contract Calls

Your game might need to interact with other contracts:

```rust
use ink::env::call::{build_call, ExecutionInput};

#[ink(message)]
pub fn call_external_contract(&mut self, contract_address: AccountId) -> Result<()> {
    let result = build_call::<Environment>()
        .call(contract_address)
        .gas_limit(5000)
        .exec_input(
            ExecutionInput::new(selector!["external_function"])
        )
        .returns::<Result<()>>()
        .invoke();

    result.map_err(|_| Error::ExternalCallFailed)
}
```

### Advanced Testing Strategies

For complex contracts, consider integration testing:

```rust
#[cfg(all(test, feature = "e2e-tests"))]
mod e2e_tests {
    use super::*;
    use ink_e2e::build_message;

    type E2EResult<T> = std::result::Result<T, Box<dyn std::error::Error>>;

    #[ink_e2e::test]
    async fn full_game_flow(mut client: ink_e2e::Client<C, E>) -> E2EResult<()> {
        // Deploy contract
        let constructor = AgarioGameRef::new(1000);
        let contract_acc_id = client
            .instantiate("agario_game", &ink_e2e::alice(), constructor, 0, None)
            .await
            .expect("instantiate failed")
            .account_id;

        // Test the full game flow with real transactions
        // ...

        Ok(())
    }
}
```
