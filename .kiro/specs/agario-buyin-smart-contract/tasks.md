# 🚀 HACKATHON MVP - Agario Smart Contract Tasks

> **⚡ HACKATHON FOCUS**: Minimal Viable Product for working demo. Advanced features marked for post-hackathon development.

## 🎯 **MVP GOAL**: Working agario contract with basic admin controls and player registration that can be demonstrated in the hackathon.

---

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: USE CLOUD BUILDS ONLY - NO LOCAL BUILDS**

> **⚠️ CRITICAL FOR HACKATHON**: To save time and disk space, **DO NOT** build locally. Use GitHub Actions cloud builds instead.

### **🌐 Cloud Build Commands:**
```bash
# Quick contract build (2-3 minutes)
./trigger-build.sh contract quick

# Full contract build with tests (4-5 minutes)
./trigger-build.sh contract full

# Full stack deployment (6-8 minutes)
./trigger-build.sh fullstack development
```

### **🎯 Why Cloud Builds:**
- **💾 Save 3GB+ disk space** (no Rust toolchain, cargo-contract, dependencies)
- **⚡ Faster builds** (2-4 min vs 5-10 min locally)
- **🤝 Team collaboration** (multiple developers can build simultaneously)
- **🚀 Automatic deployment** (contract + frontend deployed together)
- **📦 Artifacts stored** (30 days retention, downloadable)

### **📋 Manual Trigger (Alternative):**
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab
2. Select "Smart Contract - Hackathon Cloud Build" or "Hackathon Full Stack Deploy"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose options and deploy

## 🛠 **Development Commands for MVP**

### **Contract Development**
```bash
# Core development loop
cargo contract test                    # Fast unit testing
cargo contract build --release        # Build for deployment
cargo contract instantiate --suri //Alice --args 5  # Deploy to testnet

### **⚠️ HACKATHON DEVELOPMENT SETUP - USE CLOUD BUILDS**
```bash
# 🚨 RECOMMENDED: Use cloud builds to save time and space
./trigger-build.sh contract quick     # Fast development builds
./trigger-build.sh contract full      # Full builds with tests
./trigger-build.sh fullstack development # Complete deployment

# 🌐 Manual trigger alternative:
# Go to GitHub Actions → "Smart Contract - Hackathon Cloud Build"
```

### **🛠️ Local Development (Only if Cloud Fails)**
```bash
# ⚠️ ONLY USE IF CLOUD BUILDS FAIL - Requires 3GB+ disk space
# Quick validation
cargo check                           # Fast syntax check
cargo fmt                            # Auto-format code
```

### **🧪 Local Testing Setup (Emergency Only)**
```bash
# ⚠️ EMERGENCY LOCAL SETUP - Use cloud builds instead
# Terminal 1: Start local node
substrate-contracts-node --dev

# Terminal 2: Deploy and test
cd agario_buyin
cargo contract build --release
cargo contract instantiate --suri //Alice --args 5 -x
cargo contract call --suri //Bob --contract <CONTRACT_ADDR> --message deposit --value 1000000000000 -x
```

## 🎯 **Success Criteria for MVP Demo**

### **Must Demonstrate:**
1. ✅ **Admin Flow**: Connect wallet → Start game → Set buy-in
2. ✅ **Player Flow**: Connect different wallet → Deposit → Join game
3. ✅ **Game End**: Admin selects winners → Prize distribution
4. ✅ **State Updates**: UI reflects contract state changes in real-time

### **Demo Script (2 minutes):**
1. **Admin starts game** - "I'm the admin, starting a new game with 1 DOT buy-in"
2. **Players join** - "Players connect wallets and deposit to join"
3. **Game progress** - "We can see X players registered, prize pool growing"
4. **Game ends** - "Admin declares winners, prizes distributed automatically"
5. **State reset** - "Contract ready for next game"

## 🔧 **Simplified Architecture Decisions for MVP**

### **What We're Keeping Simple:**
- **H160 Addresses** - Ethereum-compatible addresses for future cross-chain support
- **Basic Error Handling** - Simple enum, user-friendly messages later
- **Single Game Mode** - One game at a time, no multiple instances
- **Manual Winner Selection** - Admin picks winners, automated scoring later
- **Modern SDK Only** - Focus on @polkadot-api/sdk-ink with local signers

### **What We'll Improve Post-Hackathon:**
- **Advanced UI/UX** - Better design, animations, mobile responsiveness
- **Automated Game Flow** - Time-based transitions, registration deadlines
- **Advanced Security** - Reentrancy protection, formal verification
- **Cross-Chain Integration** - Bridge to Ethereum, leverage H160 compatibility
- **Mobile App** - Native iOS/Android with Ethereum wallet integration

---

## 🚨 **MVP Risk Mitigation**

### **Time Management:**
- ⏰ **4-hour contract target** - If behind, cut testing/optimization
- ⏰ **3-hour frontend target** - If behind, skip animations and focus on core demo
- ⏰ **1-hour buffer** - Final integration testing and bug fixes

### **Technical Risks:**
- 🐛 **Deployment Issues** - Have local node ready as backup
- 🐛 **Frontend Integration** - Test contract calls early, not at the end
- 🐛 **Wallet Connection** - Have multiple test accounts ready
- 🐛 **Event Monitoring** - Polling fallback if subscription fails

### **Demo Backup Plan:**
- 📱 **Screenshots/Video** - Record successful demo in case of live issues
- 🧪 **Local Demo** - Run everything locally if network issues
- 📋 **Manual Simulation** - Talk through the flow with UI mockups if needed

---

## 🏆 **Success Metrics**

### **Technical Success:**
- ✅ Contract deploys and instantiates successfully
- ✅ All core functions work (start, deposit, end)
- ✅ Frontend connects and calls contract methods
- ✅ Events are emitted and received by frontend

### **Demo Success:**
- ✅ Complete user flow demonstrated in <2 minutes
- ✅ Multiple wallets interact with same contract
- ✅ Prize distribution happens automatically
- ✅ Audience understands the concept and implementation

### **Judges' Criteria Alignment:**
- ✅ **Innovation**: Novel application of smart contracts to gaming
- ✅ **Technical Execution**: Working ink! contract with frontend
- ✅ **User Experience**: Clear demo showing end-to-end flow
- ✅ **Business Potential**: Clear path to production deployment

---

*🎯 Remember: The goal is a working demo, not a production-ready system. Focus on core functionality that showcases the concept clearly.*
