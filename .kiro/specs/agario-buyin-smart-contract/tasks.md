# üöÄ HACKATHON MVP - Agario Smart Contract Tasks

> **‚ö° HACKATHON FOCUS**: Minimal Viable Product for working demo. Advanced features marked for post-hackathon development.

## üéØ **MVP GOAL**: Working agario contract with basic admin controls and player registration that can be demonstrated in the hackathon.

---

## üî• **MUST HAVE - Core MVP Tasks** (Target: 4-6 hours)

### **‚úÖ COMPLETED**
- [x] **Task 1: Project Setup & Foundation** ‚úÖ DONE
  - ‚úÖ Contract builds successfully with `cargo contract build`
  - ‚úÖ Unit tests pass (2/2 passing)
  - ‚úÖ Basic structure in place with AccountId (keeping simple for MVP)
  - ‚úÖ All dependencies configured correctly

### **üî• MVP CRITICAL PATH**

- [ ] **Task 2: Core Storage & Types** (45 min)
  ```rust
  #[ink(storage)]
  pub struct AgarioBuyin {
      admin: AccountId,
      game_state: GameState,
      buy_in_amount: Balance,
      // Registration & Timing
      registration_deadline: Timestamp,
      min_players: u32,
      max_players: Option<u32>,
      // Game Duration & End Conditions
      game_duration: Option<Timestamp>, // None = no time limit
      game_start_time: Timestamp,
      // Players & Prize Pool
      players: Mapping<AccountId, ()>,
      player_count: u32,
      prize_pool: Balance,
      // Admin Configuration
      admin_fee_percentage: u8, // 0-100
  }

  enum GameState {
      Inactive,
      AcceptingDeposits,
      InProgress,
      WaitingForResults, // NEW: Game ended, waiting for winner submission
  }

  enum GameEndReason {
      TimeLimit,
      LastPlayerStanding,
      AdminForced,
  }
  ```
  - Enhanced Error enum: `NotAdmin | WrongState | WrongAmount | GameNotStarted | RegistrationClosed | GameFull | TooFewPlayers`
  - _Target: Complete storage with timing logic_

- [ ] **Task 3: Enhanced Game Management** (120 min)
  - `start_game(buy_in: Balance, registration_minutes: u32, min_players: u32, game_duration_minutes: Option<u32>)` - Admin configures and starts game
  - `deposit()` - Payable function with registration deadline and player limit checks
  - `try_begin_game()` - Auto-transition from AcceptingDeposits to InProgress when conditions met
  - `report_game_end(reason: GameEndReason)` - Game server reports game completion
  - `submit_winners(winners: Vec<AccountId>, winner_percentages: Vec<u8>)` - Admin submits winners with prize distribution
  - `get_game_state()`, `get_player_count()`, `get_time_remaining()` - Enhanced queries
  - _Target: Complete game lifecycle with timing_

- [ ] **Task 4: Game Timing & Validation** (45 min)
  ```rust
  #[ink(message)]
  pub fn check_game_conditions(&mut self) -> Result<(), Error> {
      let now = self.env().block_timestamp();

      match self.game_state {
          GameState::AcceptingDeposits => {
              // Check if registration deadline passed
              if now >= self.registration_deadline {
                  if self.player_count >= self.min_players {
                      self.game_state = GameState::InProgress;
                      self.game_start_time = now;
                      self.env().emit_event(GameBegan { player_count: self.player_count });
                  } else {
                      // Refund all players and reset
                      self.refund_all_players()?;
                  }
              }
          },
          GameState::InProgress => {
              // Check if game duration exceeded
              if let Some(duration) = self.game_duration {
                  if now >= self.game_start_time + duration {
                      self.game_state = GameState::WaitingForResults;
                      self.env().emit_event(GameTimeExpired {});
                  }
              }
          },
          _ => {}
      }
      Ok(())
  }
  ```
  - Auto-refund mechanism for failed games
  - Time-based state transitions
  - _Target: Automated game progression_

- [ ] **Task 5: Winner Detection & Prize Distribution** (60 min)
  ```rust
  #[ink(message)]
  pub fn submit_winners(&mut self, winners: Vec<AccountId>, percentages: Vec<u8>) -> Result<(), Error> {
      // Validate admin and state
      if self.env().caller() != self.admin { return Err(Error::NotAdmin); }
      if self.game_state != GameState::WaitingForResults { return Err(Error::WrongState); }
      if winners.len() != percentages.len() { return Err(Error::MismatchedData); }
      if percentages.iter().sum::<u8>() > 100 { return Err(Error::InvalidPercentages); }

      // Calculate and distribute prizes
      let admin_cut = (self.prize_pool * self.admin_fee_percentage as Balance) / 100;
      let winner_pool = self.prize_pool - admin_cut;

      for (winner, percentage) in winners.iter().zip(percentages.iter()) {
          let prize = (winner_pool * *percentage as Balance) / 100;
          self.env().transfer(*winner, prize).map_err(|_| Error::TransferFailed)?;
      }

      // Transfer admin fee
      self.env().transfer(self.admin, admin_cut).map_err(|_| Error::TransferFailed)?;

      // Reset game
      self.reset_game_state();
      self.env().emit_event(GameEnded { winners: winners.clone(), total_distributed: self.prize_pool });
      Ok(())
  }
  ```
  - Percentage-based prize distribution
  - Validation for winner data
  - _Target: Fair and flexible prize system_

- [ ] **Task 6: Enhanced Events & Game Server Integration** (45 min)
  ```rust
  #[ink(event)]
  pub struct GameStarted {
      buy_in: Balance,
      registration_deadline: Timestamp,
      min_players: u32,
      game_duration: Option<Timestamp>
  }

```bash
# Core development loop
cargo contract test                    # Fast unit testing
cargo contract build --release        # Build for deployment
cargo contract instantiate --suri //Alice --args 5  # Deploy to testnet

# Quick validation
cargo check                           # Fast syntax check
cargo fmt                            # Auto-format code
```

### **Local Testing Setup**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start local node
substrate-contracts-node --dev

# Terminal 2: Deploy and test
cd agario_buyin
cargo contract build --release

## üéØ **Success Criteria for MVP Demo**

### **Must Demonstrate:**
1. ‚úÖ **Admin Flow**: Connect wallet ‚Üí Start game ‚Üí Set buy-in
2. ‚úÖ **Player Flow**: Connect different wallet ‚Üí Deposit ‚Üí Join game
3. ‚úÖ **Game End**: Admin selects winners ‚Üí Prize distribution
4. ‚úÖ **State Updates**: UI reflects contract state changes in real-time

### **Demo Script (2 minutes):**
1. **Admin starts game** - "I'm the admin, starting a new game with 1 DOT buy-in"
2. **Players join** - "Players connect wallets and deposit to join"
3. **Game progress** - "We can see X players registered, prize pool growing"
4. **Game ends** - "Admin declares winners, prizes distributed automatically"
5. **State reset** - "Contract ready for next game"

## üîß **Simplified Architecture Decisions for MVP**

### **What We're Keeping Simple:**
- **AccountId instead of H160** - Avoid migration complexity for demo
- **Basic Error Handling** - Simple enum, user-friendly messages later
- **Single Game Mode** - One game at a time, no multiple instances
- **Manual Winner Selection** - Admin picks winners, automated scoring later
- **Polkadot.js Only** - Skip multi-wallet complexity for MVP

### **What We'll Improve Post-Hackathon:**
- **H160 Migration** - Ethereum-style addresses for better UX
- **Automated Game Flow** - Time-based transitions, registration deadlines
- **Advanced Security** - Reentrancy protection, formal verification
- **Cross-Chain Support** - Bridge to Ethereum, other networks
- **Mobile App** - Native iOS/Android with better UX

---

## üö® **MVP Risk Mitigation**

### **Time Management:**
- ‚è∞ **4-hour contract target** - If behind, cut testing/optimization
- ‚è∞ **3-hour frontend target** - If behind, skip animations and focus on core demo
- ‚è∞ **1-hour buffer** - Final integration testing and bug fixes

### **Technical Risks:**
- üêõ **Deployment Issues** - Have local node ready as backup
- üêõ **Frontend Integration** - Test contract calls early, not at the end
- üêõ **Wallet Connection** - Have multiple test accounts ready
- üêõ **Event Monitoring** - Polling fallback if subscription fails

### **Demo Backup Plan:**
- üì± **Screenshots/Video** - Record successful demo in case of live issues
- üß™ **Local Demo** - Run everything locally if network issues
- üìã **Manual Simulation** - Talk through the flow with UI mockups if needed

---

## üèÜ **Success Metrics**

### **Technical Success:**
- ‚úÖ Contract deploys and instantiates successfully
- ‚úÖ All core functions work (start, deposit, end)
- ‚úÖ Frontend connects and calls contract methods
- ‚úÖ Events are emitted and received by frontend

### **Demo Success:**
- ‚úÖ Complete user flow demonstrated in <2 minutes
- ‚úÖ Multiple wallets interact with same contract
- ‚úÖ Prize distribution happens automatically
- ‚úÖ Audience understands the concept and implementation

### **Judges' Criteria Alignment:**
- ‚úÖ **Innovation**: Novel application of smart contracts to gaming
- ‚úÖ **Technical Execution**: Working ink! contract with frontend
- ‚úÖ **User Experience**: Clear demo showing end-to-end flow
- ‚úÖ **Business Potential**: Clear path to production deployment

---

*üéØ Remember: The goal is a working demo, not a production-ready system. Focus on core functionality that showcases the concept clearly.*
