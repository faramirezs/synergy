## Integration Architecture Overview

### Frontend Components Structure:
```
src/client/js/
├── wallet-service.js        # Polkadot wallet connection and management
├── contract-service.js      # Smart contract interface and ABI handling
├── game-contract.js         # Game-specific contract integration
├── admin-controls.js        # Administrator interface components
├── player-registration.js   # Player deposit and registration UI
├── prize-distribution.js    # Winner selection and prize handling
├── event-monitor.js         # Contract event monitoring service
├── transaction-manager.js   # Transaction status and monitoring
└── contract-utils.js        # Utility functions for contract operations
```

### UI Integration Points:
- **Start Menu**: Add wallet connection, registration status, and deposit options
- **Game UI**: Integrate contract status display with existing leaderboard
- **Admin Panel**: Add contract administration controls to chat commands
- **Chat System**: Extend for contract notifications and error messages
- **Settings**: Add contract configuration options

### Contract Integration Flow:
1. **Game Session Start**: Admin calls start_game() → UI updates to show registration
2. **Player Registration**: Players connect wallet → deposit() → registration confirmation
3. **Game Begin**: Auto-call try_begin_game() after deadline → game starts
4. **Game End**: Determine winners → admin calls end_game() → prize distribution
5. **Reset**: Contract returns to Inactive state → ready for new game

### Error Handling Strategy:
- Map contract errors to user-friendly messages
- Integrate with existing chat notification system
- Provide retry mechanisms for failed transactions
- Add fallback UI states for contract unavailability

### Testing Strategy:
- Unit tests for each contract service module
- Integration tests for complete user flows
- End-to-end tests with testnet contract deployment
- Performance tests for contract operation optimization
