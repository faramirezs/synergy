**Root Cause Analysis** (CORRECTED - July 17, 2025):
1. **🔴 CRITICAL**: JavaScript Bundle Still Compiled for Node.js - Webpack configuration fix not taking effect in production
2. **🔴 CRITICAL**: Azure deployment serving incorrect bundle version - build/deployment pipeline issue
3. **🔴 CRITICAL**: Client-side application completely non-functional due to persistent 'require is not defined' errors
4. **🟡 HIGH**: Multiple browser extension conflicts causing console spam and potential interference
5. **🟡 MEDIUM**: Extension communication failures creating persistent error loops
6. **🟡 MEDIUM**: Dynamic import failures for browser extension modules
7. **🟢 LOW**: Server-side functionality working correctly (database, static serving)

**Progress Update** (July 17, 2025 - CRITICAL JAVASCRIPT BUNDLE ISSUE PERSISTS):
1. **✅ Container Startup Success**: Container initializes reliably in 87 seconds
2. **✅ Azure Warmup Success**: Application responds to Azure warmup requests
3. **✅ Server Initialization**: Database connection, tables created, game logic initialized
4. **✅ Application Server**: Listening on 0.0.0.0:8080, server started successfully
5. **🔴 JavaScript Bundle STILL BROKEN**: Webpack configuration not properly applied - still getting 'require is not defined'
6. **🔴 Client-Side Bundle FAILING**: Critical error preventing all JavaScript execution
7. **✅ Static Assets Serving**: All assets returning 200 OK - CSS, JS, favicon working (server-side)
8. **✅ Local Testing Validated**: Application runs perfectly locally on port 3000
9. **✅ Performance Metrics**: Response times under 2ms, health endpoints working
10. **✅ WebSocket Ready**: Socket.IO endpoints configured and responding
11. **🔴 CRITICAL: Complete Application Failure**: JavaScript bundle errors prevent ALL client-side functionality
12. **🟡 Browser Extension Conflicts**: 30+ error messages spamming console continuously

## 🚨 **CRITICAL STATUS SUMMARY (July 17, 2025 - Updated with New Console Errors)**

### **🔴 CRITICAL FAILURE: JavaScript Bundle Issue NOT Resolved**
The critical JavaScript bundle issue persists despite previous fix attempts. The application remains completely non-functional in production.

### **🔧 Current Failure Analysis**
1. **🔴 Root Cause Confirmed**: Azure serving JavaScript bundle compiled for Node.js, not browser
2. **🔴 Webpack Config Issue**: Configuration changes not taking effect in production deployment
3. **🔴 Build Pipeline Problem**: Local builds work, but Azure deployment pipeline not using correct build
4. **🔴 Complete Client Failure**: All JavaScript execution blocked by "require is not defined" errors

### **📊 Technical Evidence**
- **🔴 JavaScript Bundle**: Still contains Node.js `require()` statements incompatible with browsers
- **🔴 Critical Error**: "Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined" at multiple module load points
- **🔴 Module System Conflict**: Bundle using CommonJS instead of browser-compatible format
- **🟡 Extension Conflicts**: Secondary issues with browser extension resource loading
- **✅ Server Infrastructure**: Backend fully operational and serving static assets correctly

### **🎯 Current Non-Functional Status**
- 🔴 **Client-Side JavaScript**: Completely broken - no execution possible
- 🔴 **User Interface**: Non-responsive - no button clicks or interactions work
- 🔴 **Game Functionality**: Impossible to test - JavaScript runtime fails immediately
- 🔴 **WebSocket Connections**: Cannot be established due to JavaScript failure
- ✅ **Static Asset Delivery**: Working (HTML, CSS, images load correctly)
- ✅ **Server Backend**: Fully functional (database, API endpoints operational)

### **📋 Required Critical Actions**
1. **🔴 URGENT**: Investigate why webpack `target: 'web'` configuration not taking effect in Azure
2. **🔴 URGENT**: Verify Azure build process using correct webpack configuration
3. **🔴 URGENT**: Check if Azure Oryx build system overriding local build configuration
4. **🔴 URGENT**: Validate deployment package contains browser-compatible JavaScript bundle
5. **🔴 URGENT**: Test alternative deployment method if current pipeline corrupting build

### **⏱️ Issue Timeline**
- **Previous Status**: July 17, 2025 15:12 UTC - Incorrectly marked as "RESOLVED"
- **Reality Check**: July 17, 2025 17:00+ UTC - Issue confirmed still present
- **Current Status**: July 17, 2025 - **CRITICAL FAILURE ONGOING**
- **User Impact**: **COMPLETE APPLICATION UNUSABILITY**

### **🏆 Business Impact**
- 🔴 **Production Status**: COMPLETELY NON-FUNCTIONAL
- 🔴 **User Experience**: APPLICATION UNUSABLE
- 🔴 **Development Workflow**: BLOCKED until JavaScript bundle fixed
- 🔴 **Technical Debt**: CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURE

**🎯 STATUS: CRITICAL JAVASCRIPT BUNDLE FAILURE - APPLICATION COMPLETELY BROKEN**
