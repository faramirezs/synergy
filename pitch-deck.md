# 🎮 **GameTreasury Protocol**
## Smart Contract Infrastructure for Game Monetization

### *Lowering the barrier for game studios to integrate blockchain treasuries*

---

## 🎯 **The Problem**

### Game Studios Want Blockchain Integration But...

**🚫 High Technical Barriers**
- Complex smart contract development
- Security vulnerabilities and exploits
- Lack of game-specific patterns

**🚫 Time & Cost Constraints**
- 6-12 months development time
- $200K+ development costs
- Specialized blockchain talent shortage

**🚫 Reinventing the Wheel**
- Every studio builds treasury logic from scratch
- Common patterns duplicated across projects
- No standardized, battle-tested solutions

### **Result:** 95% of game studios never integrate blockchain features

---

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Core Smart Contract (ink! + Polkadot)**

```rust
pub struct GameTreasury {
    // 🎮 Game Management
    game_state: GameState,
    buy_in_amount: Balance,
    min_players: u32,

    // ⏰ Timing & Registration
    registration_deadline: Timestamp,
    game_duration: Option<Timestamp>,

    // 💰 Prize Pool Management
    players: Mapping<H160, ()>,
    prize_pool: Balance,
    admin_fee_percentage: u8,
}
```

### **Complete Game Lifecycle Management**

1. **🚀 Game Setup** - Admin configures buy-in, players, timing
2. **📝 Registration** - Players deposit tokens to join
3. **🎯 Game Execution** - Off-chain game logic with on-chain validation
4. **🏆 Prize Distribution** - Automated winner payouts with configurable percentages
5. **🔄 Reset** - Clean state for next game round

### **Appendix: Technical Deep Dive**

#### **Smart Contract Features**

```rust
// Core treasury functionality
impl GameTreasury {
    // Game lifecycle management
    pub fn start_game(&mut self, buy_in: Balance,
                       registration_minutes: u32,
                       min_players: u32) -> Result<()>

    // Player registration with payment
    #[ink(message, payable)]
    pub fn deposit(&mut self) -> Result<()>

    // Automated game state transitions
    pub fn try_begin_game(&mut self) -> Result<()>

    // Secure prize distribution
    pub fn submit_winners(&mut self, winners: Vec<H160>,
                          percentages: Vec<u8>) -> Result<()>
